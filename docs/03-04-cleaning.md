## Clearing Instances

It's possible to clean all instances associated with registrations from the container with `clearInstances`

```typescript
clearInstances(): Promise<void>;
```

**NOTE:** This method is async because of the disposition of instances that may implement `AsyncDispose`

## Reset

To clean all the scopes and registrations associated with the container, use `reset()`

```typescript
reset(): Promise<void>;
```

**NOTE:** This method is async because of the disposition of instances that may implement `AsyncDispose`
